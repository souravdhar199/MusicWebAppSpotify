## Technical Issues :
1. In the requirements.txt file, I put pyhton-dotenv and heroku was giving me error abiut this then I changed it to python-dotenv==0.10.1 and it worked. 
2. I also had a problem with not updating css as I was changing those files. Solved this issue by pressing clt+F5 together.
3. Also I could not change my config on heroku for database url. But I was able to change it using some couple lines of code in discord.
